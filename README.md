# TangleMango

TangleMango looks at the links between webpages to guess at the structure of websites. In practice, this means you can for instance easily find a chain of pages that are connected by previous/next links, without requiring any site-specific or even language-specific work. Handy for scrapping image galeries, and more.

(prev/next chains is actually the only thing that's supported to date. It's a start!)
